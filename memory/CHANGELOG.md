captures what has been implemented and when.

## 2026-02-07 — V3.0 Phase 6.1c: Wall/Partition Clipping for Lighting Visualization

Fixture light gradients on the top-down floor canvas now respect room
partition walls — a lamp in Office 1 no longer bleeds into Office 2 or
the corridor.  End-to-end shipped: DXF room extraction → DB storage →
canvas clipping.

**Backend (Red5-ELC-V3.0):**
- `elc/config/store.py`: added `rooms_json` column to the `floors`
  table schema, plus an additive `ALTER TABLE` migration for legacy
  DBs that were created before the column existed.
- `elc/floors/store.py`: plumbed `rooms` through `create_floor` /
  `update_floor` / `get_floor` / `list_floors` with a new
  `_validate_rooms` guard (>=3 vertex pairs per polygon).
- `elc/floors/dxf.py`: `DxfConversion` now carries a `rooms` list;
  `_extract_rooms()` pulls every closed LWPOLYLINE on layer `ROOMS`
  out of the modelspace, translates to metres with a Y-flip so
  coordinates match the SVG viewport, and returns
  `{id, name, vertices}` dicts.  The ROOMS layer is turned off
  before SVG rendering so the polygons are invisible in the plan
  itself.
- `elc/floors/routes.py`: `POST /floors`, `PATCH /floors/{id}`, and
  `POST /floors/import-dxf` all accept / return `rooms`.
- `scripts/make_sample_dxf.py`: new `_room()` helper emits closed
  polylines on the `ROOMS` layer + XDATA room names.  The 40×25 m
  office sample now carries 9 rooms (4 offices, kitchen, corridor,
  2 meeting rooms, open workspace); warehouse sample carries 2.

**Frontend (`demo/floor.html`):**
- Added `pointInPolygon`, `findContainingRoom`, `tracePolygonPath`
  helpers.
- In `paintCanvas()`, each fixture's radial gradient is now drawn
  inside a `save() → clip() → restore()` block.  Clip region is the
  smallest room polygon containing the fixture; if none matches
  (e.g., corridor without a closed boundary in the DXF), clip
  falls back to the floor's outer bounding box so light doesn't
  spill off the plan.

**Tests:**
- `tests/floors/test_dxf.py::TestRoomExtraction` (3 cases): rooms
  extracted, no-ROOMS-layer returns empty, open polylines ignored.
- `tests/floors/test_store.py::TestRooms` (5 cases): default empty,
  create/update/read round-trips, validation errors.
- `tests/floors/test_store.py::TestSchemaMigration` (1 case): legacy
  DB without `rooms_json` gets the column added on init.
- `tests/integration/test_floors_routes.py::test_dxf_rooms_land_on_floor`
  end-to-end.
- Full suite: **340 tests, all green** (up from 329).

**Verification:**
Screenshot at `/tmp/floor_final.png` shows Office 1, Office 2,
Corridor, and Meeting Room A each with a bounded light gradient
that stops cleanly at the partition walls.
